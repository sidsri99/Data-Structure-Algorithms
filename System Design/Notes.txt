System design

System Design is the process of designing the architecture, components, and interfaces for a system so that it meets the end-user requirements.


Use Case diagram: Use case diagram are simplified diagram or map that defines who the user of the system are and what operations or functions they need to perform.

Software Development Life Cycle(SDLC) : 
  i.   Planning and requirement analysis.
  ii.  Defining Requirement.
  iii. Designing architechture.
  iv.  Developing Product.
  v.   Project Testing & Integration.
  vi.  Deployment & maintainance of product.

Scalibility is the ability to adjust the capacity of the system to cost efficiently fulfill the demands.
Horizontal scaling and Vertical Scaling: 
Vertical scaling is accomplished by upgrading the hardware and/or network throughput.
Horizontal scaling is accomplished by increasing number of servers.

Load Balancer: A Load balancer is a software or hardware component that distributes traffic coming to a single IP address over multiple servers,
which are hidden behind  the load balancer.

CAP Theorem: It stands for Consistency, Availability & Partition.
The theorem states that a distributed system can provide two of three properties simultaneously.
